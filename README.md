# pds-azure-cloud-resume
This is my resume for the Azure Cloud Resume Challenge

The challenge includes deploying Azure resources via IaC (CosmosDB and Python Function App), a frontend website with CSS, HTTPS and Azure CDN endpoints, a Python API that interacts with an Azure CosmosDB database, a JavaScript counter that gets input from the API and CI/CD pipelines for both backend and frontend.
